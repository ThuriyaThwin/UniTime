/**
 * (Batch) student sectioning neighbour selection. It is based on
 * {@link RoundRobinNeighbourSelection}, the following steps are involved:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Phase 1: section all students using incremental branch & bound (no
 * unassignments) ({@link BranchBoundSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 2: pick a student (one by one) with an incomplete schedule, try to
 * find an improvement ({@link SwapStudentSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 3: use standard value selection for some time (
 * {@link StandardSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 4: use backtrack neighbour selection ({@link BacktrackSelection} is
 * used)
 * <li>Phase 5: pick a student (one by one) with an incomplete schedule, try to
 * find an improvement, identify problematic students (
 * {@link SwapStudentSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 6: random unassignment of some problematic students (
 * {@link RndUnProblStudSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 7: resection incomplete students (
 * {@link ResectionIncompleteStudentsSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 8: resection of students that were unassigned in step 6 (
 * {@link ResectionUnassignedStudentsSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 9: pick a student (one by one) with an incomplete schedule, try to
 * find an improvement ({@link SwapStudentSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 10: use standard value selection for some time (
 * {@link StandardSelection} with {@link RouletteWheelRequestSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 11: pick a student (one by one) with an incomplete schedule, try to
 * find an improvement ({@link SwapStudentSelection} is used)
 * <li>Phase 12: use backtrack neighbour selection ({@link BacktrackSelection}
 * is used)
 * <li>Phase 13: random unassignment of some students (
 * {@link RandomUnassignmentSelection} is used)
 * </ul>
